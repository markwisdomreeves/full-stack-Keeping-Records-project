#### TO BUILD AND COMPLETE THIS PROJECT, IT TOKE ME THREE WEEKS TO BUILD THIS PROJECT AND IT HAS HELPED ME TO DO A LOT OF RESOURSES ON THE INTERNET. IT HAS HELPED ME TO LEARNED A LOT OF GREAT SKILLS AND IDEAS IN BUILDING A MERN STACK PROJECT. 

#### TO RUN THE PROJECT: First, go into the parent folder of the project and then run npm install. This command will install all the dependences and dev dependences for the backend.
#### NEXT, in the parent folder, enter into the client folder and run npm install. This will install all dependences and dev dependences for the for the frontend or client.

#### NOTE that you must create a Enviroment Variables file in the parent folder directory (.env file). And after that, you must add all the Local Variables in that file (.env file) like: the mongodb url connection and others.
#### Lastly, after that, run npm start in both of the folders directories (in both the parent and client folder) to start the project live.
